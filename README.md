# Puzzles Reloaded

An implementation of the [Simon Tatham Portable Puzzle Collection](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/puzzles/) for iOS & macOS.

In addition to the games from the main collections, it also provides a set of new games by [x-sheep](https://github.com/x-sheep/puzzles-unreleased). 50 games in total are currently supported!

## Adding new games & maintaining submodules

The app should compile in xcode out of the box with no added dependencies.

The puzzle collection maintains a list of games, in a locally cached file named `generated-games.h`. This was created from the cmake commands nested inside simon-tatham puzzles. When new games are added or new file dependencies are added from this or other submodules, these files must be wired into the app's compiler & new games added to `generated-games.h` to be picked up correctly.
