 Class represents the functions on the 'midend', the object that connects the puzzle backend to our code here.
 The actual midend object is provided as an `OpaquePointer` and the midend methods are provided globally by the puzzle code.
 This class attempts to organize & clean up these methods & prevent any 'non-swift-y' language to escape.

        //This function will create a new game_drawstate, but does not actually perform a redraw (since you often need to call midend_size() before the redraw can be done). So after calling this function and after calling midend_size(), you should then call midend_redraw(). (It is not necessary to call midend_force_redraw(); that will discard the draw state and create a fresh one, which is unnecessary in this case since there's a fresh one already. It would work, but it's usually excessive.)
        
        //void midend_size(midend *me, int *x, int *y, bool user_size, double device_pixel_ratio);
        // midend_size(me, &w, &h, FALSE, 1.0);
        
        /*
         Use user_size to indicate whether *x and *y are a requested size, or just a maximum size.

         If user_size is set to true, the mid-end will treat the input size as a request, and will pick a tile size which approximates it as closely as possible, going over the game's preferred tile size if necessary to achieve this. The mid-end will also use the resulting tile size as its preferred one until further notice, on the assumption that this size was explicitly requested by the user. Use this option if you want your front end to support dynamic resizing of the puzzle window with automatic scaling of the puzzle to fit.

         If user_size is set to false, then the game's tile size will never go over its preferred one, although it may go under in order to fit within the maximum bounds specified by *x and *y. This is the recommended approach when opening a new window at default size: the game will use its preferred size unless it has to use a smaller one to fit on the screen. If the tile size is shrunk for this reason, the change will not persist; if a smaller grid is subsequently chosen, the tile size will recover.

         The mid-end will try as hard as it can to return a size which is less than or equal to the input size, in both dimensions. In extreme circumstances it may fail (if even the lowest possible tile size gives window dimensions greater than the input), in which case it will return a size greater than the input size. Front ends should be prepared for this to happen (i.e. don't crash or fail an assertion), but may handle it in any way they see fit: by rejecting the game parameters which caused the problem, by opening a window larger than the screen regardless of inconvenience, by introducing scroll bars on the window, by drawing on a large bitmap and scaling it into a smaller window, or by any other means you can think of. It is likely that when the tile size is that small the game will be unplayable anyway, so don't put too much effort into handling it creatively.
