Otherwise, a number appears at the firing point and the location where the beam emerges (this number is unique to that shot).\n\nYou can place guesses as to the location of the balls, based on the entry and exit patterns of the beams; once you have placed enough balls a button appears enabling you to have your guesses checked.\n\nFor this reason, when you have your guesses checked, the game will check that your solution produces the same results as the computer's, rather than that your solution is identical to the computer's.

If there are already as many bridges between the two islands as permitted by the current game rules (i.e. two by default), the same dragging action will remove all of them.\n\nIf you want to remind yourself that two islands definitely do not have a bridge between them, you can right-drag between them in the same way to draw a ‘non-bridge’ marker.\n\nIf you think you have finished with an island (i.e. you have placed all its bridges and are confident that they are in the right places), you can mark the island as finished by left-clicking on it. This will highlight it and all the bridges connected to it, and you will be prevented from accidentally modifying any of those bridges in future. Left-clicking again on a highlighted island will unmark it and restore your ability to modify it.\n\nYou can also use the cursor keys to move around the grid: if possible the cursor will always move orthogonally, otherwise it will move towards the nearest island to the indicated direction. Holding Control and pressing a cursor key will lay a bridge in that direction (if available); Shift and a cursor key will lay a ‘non-bridge’ marker. Pressing the return key followed by a cursor key will also lay a bridge in that direction.\n\nYou can mark an island as finished by pressing the space bar or by pressing the return key twice.\n\nBy pressing a number key, you can jump to the nearest island with that number. Letters ‘a’, ..., ‘f’ count as 10, ..., 15 and ‘0’ as 16.\n\nThe ‘G’ key will draw a grey line between each pair of islands that could be connected with a bridge or non-bridge but are currently not.\n\nViolations of the puzzle rules will be marked in red:\n\nAn island with too many bridges will be highlighted in red.\nAn island with too few bridges will be highlighted in red if it is definitely an error (as opposed to merely not being finished yet): if adding enough bridges would involve having to cross another bridge or remove a non-bridge marker, or if the island has been highlighted as complete.\nA group of islands and bridges may be highlighted in red if it is a closed subset of the puzzle with no way to connect it to the rest of the islands. For example, if you directly connect two 1s together with a bridge and they are not the only two islands on the grid, they will light up red to indicate that such a group cannot be contained in any valid solution.\nIf you have selected the (non-default) option to disallow loops in the solution, a group of bridges which forms a loop will be highlighted."

You have a grid of 16 squares, six of which are blue; on one square rests a cube. Your move is to use the arrow keys to roll the cube through 90 degrees so that it moves to an adjacent square. If you roll the cube on to a blue square, the blue square is picked up on one face of the cube; if you roll a blue face of the cube on to a non-blue square, the blueness is put down again. (In general, whenever you roll the cube, the two faces that come into contact swap colours.) Your job is to get all six blue squares on to the six faces of the cube at the same time. Count your moves and try to do it in as few as possible.\n\nUnlike the original Java game, my version has an additional feature: once you've mastered the game with a cube rolling on a square grid, you can change to a triangular grid and roll any of a tetrahedron, an octahedron or an icosahedron."

A region can contain stipples in multiple colours at once. (This is often useful at the harder difficulty levels.)\n\nYou can also use the cursor keys to move around the map: the colour of the cursor indicates the position of the colour you would drag (which is not obvious if you're on a region's boundary, since it depends on the direction from which you approached the boundary). Pressing the return key starts a drag of that colour, as above, which you control with the cursor keys; pressing the return key again finishes the drag. The space bar can be used similarly to create a stippled region. Double-pressing the return key (without moving the cursor) will clear the region, as a drag from an empty region does: this is useful with the cursor mode if you have filled the entire map in but need to correct the layout.\n\nIf you press L during play, the game will toggle display of a number in each region of the map.

However, since this version generates the puzzles automatically, they will just look like random groupings of squares. (One user has suggested that this is actually a good thing, since it prevents you from guessing the colour of squares based on the picture, and forces you to use logic instead.)

The default puzzle size is 3×3 (a 9×9 actual grid, divided into nine 3×3 blocks). You can also select sizes with rectangular blocks instead of square ones, such as 2×3 (a 6×6 grid divided into six 3×2 blocks). Alternatively, you can select ‘jigsaw’ mode, in which the sub-blocks are arbitrary shapes which differ between individual puzzles.\n\nAnother available mode is ‘killer’. In this mode, clues are not given in the form of filled-in squares; instead, the grid is divided into ‘cages’ by coloured lines, and for each cage the game tells you what the sum of all the digits in that cage should be. Also, no digit may appear more than once within a cage, even if the cage crosses the boundaries of existing regions.\n\nIf you select a puzzle size which requires more than 9 digits, the additional digits will be letters of the alphabet. For example, if you select 3×4 then the digits which go in your grid will be 1 to 9, plus ‘a’, ‘b’ and ‘c’. This cannot be selected for killer puzzles.\n\nI first saw this puzzle in Nikoli [5], although it's also been popularised by various newspapers under the name ‘Sudoku’ or ‘Su Doku’. Howard Garns is considered the inventor of the modern form of the puzzle, and it was first published in Dell Pencil Puzzles and Word Games.

            "value" : "Solo allows you to configure two separate dimensions of the puzzle grid on the ‘Type’ menu: the number of columns, and the number of rows, into which the main grid is divided. (The size of a block is the inverse of this: for example, if you select 2 columns and 3 rows, each actual block will have 3 columns and 2 rows.)\n\nIf you tick the ‘X’ checkbox, Solo will apply the optional extra constraint that the two main diagonals of the grid also contain one of every digit. (This is sometimes known as ‘Sudoku-X’ in newspapers.) In this mode, the squares on the two main diagonals will be shaded slightly so that you know it's enabled.\n\nIf you tick the ‘Jigsaw’ checkbox, Solo will generate randomly shaped sub-blocks. In this mode, the actual grid size will be taken to be the product of the numbers entered in the ‘Columns’ and ‘Rows’ boxes. There is no reason why you have to enter a number greater than 1 in both boxes; Jigsaw mode has no constraint on the grid size, and it can even be a prime number if you feel like it.\n\nIf you tick the ‘Killer’ checkbox, Solo will generate a set of of cages, which are randomly shaped and drawn in an outline of a different colour. Each of these regions contains a smaller clue which shows the digit sum of all the squares in this region.\n\nYou can also configure the type of symmetry shown in the generated puzzles. More symmetry makes the puzzles look prettier but may also make them easier, since the symmetry constraints can force more clues than necessary to be present. Completely asymmetric puzzles have the freedom to contain as few clues as possible.\n\nFinally, you can configure the difficulty of the generated puzzles. Difficulty levels are judged by the complexity of the techniques of deduction required to solve the puzzle: each level requires a mode of reasoning which was not necessary in the previous one. In particular, on difficulty levels ‘Trivial’ and ‘Basic’ there will be a square you can fill in with a single number at all times, whereas at ‘Intermediate’ level and beyond you will have to make partial deductions about the set of squares a number could be in (or the set of numbers that could be in a square). At ‘Unreasonable’ level, even this is not enough, and you will eventually have to make a guess, and then backtrack if it turns out to be wrong.\n\nGenerating difficult puzzles is itself difficult: if you select one of the higher difficulty levels, Solo may have to make many attempts at generating a puzzle before it finds one hard enough for you. Be prepared to wait, especially if you have also configured a large puzzle size."

Pressing return toggles the highlight into a mode in which you can enter or remove pencil marks.\n\nIf you prefer plain letters of the alphabet to cute monster pictures, you can press ‘A’ to toggle between showing the monsters as monsters or showing them as letters.\n\nLeft-clicking a clue will mark it as done (grey it out), or unmark it if it is already marked."

Every square which is not a mirror must be filled with one of three types of undead monster: a ghost, a vampire, or a zombie.\n\nVampires can be seen directly, but are invisible when reflected in mirrors. Ghosts are the opposite way round: they can be seen in mirrors, but are invisible when looked at directly. Zombies are visible by any means.\n\nYou are also told the total number of each type of monster in the grid. Also around the edge of the grid are written numbers, which indicate how many monsters can be seen if you look into the grid along a row or column starting from that position. (The diagonal mirrors are reflective on both sides. If your reflected line of sight crosses the same monster more than once, the number will count it each time it is visible, not just once.)\n\nThis puzzle type was invented by David Millar, under the name ‘Haunted Mirror Maze’.

If you make a mistake, click the mouse in the incorrect square and press Space to clear it again (or use the Undo feature).\n\nIf you right-click in a square and then type a number, that number will be entered in the square as a ‘pencil mark’. You can have pencil marks for multiple numbers in the same square. Squares containing filled-in numbers cannot also contain pencil marks.\n\nThe game pays no attention to pencil marks, so exactly what you use them for is up to you: you can use them as reminders that a particular square needs to be re-examined once you know more about a particular number, or you can use them as lists of the possible numbers in a given square, or anything else you feel like.\n\nTo erase a single pencil mark, right-click in the square and type the same number again.\n\nAll pencil marks in a square are erased when you left-click and type a number, or when you left-click and press space. Right-clicking and pressing space will also erase pencil marks.\n\nAs for Solo, the cursor keys can be used in conjunction with the digit keys to set numbers or pencil marks. You can also use the ‘M’ key to auto-fill every numeric hint, ready for removal as required, or the ‘H’ key to do the same but also to remove all obvious hints.\n\nAlternatively, use the cursor keys to move the mark around the grid. Pressing the return key toggles the mark (from a normal mark to a pencil mark), and typing a number in is entered in the square in the appropriate way; typing in a 0 or using the space bar will clear a filled square.\n\nLeft-clicking a clue will mark it as done (grey it out), or unmark it if it is already marked. Holding Control or Shift and pressing an arrow key likewise marks any clue adjacent to the cursor in the given direction."

In this mode all clues are always visible: absence of a bar thus means that a square's value is definitely not numerically adjacent to that neighbour's.\n\nIn ‘Trivial’ difficulty level (available via the ‘Custom’ game type selector), there are no greater-than signs in ‘Unequal’ mode; the puzzle is to solve the Latin square only.\n\nAt the time of writing, the ‘Unequal’ mode of this puzzle is appearing in the Guardian weekly under the name ‘Futoshiki’.\n\nUnequal was contributed to this collection by James Harvey."
