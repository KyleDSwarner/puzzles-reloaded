You can also select multiple squares for numbering or clearing with the return and arrow keys, before typing a digit to fill or clear the highlighted squares (as above).

No region has an area greater than 9 (because then its area would not be a single digit).\n\nCredit for this puzzle goes to [Nikoli](https://www.nikoli.co.jp/en/puzzles/fillomino/)\n\nFilling was contributed to this collection by Jonas Kölker."

Drag with the left button from a square to its successor, or with the right button from a square to its predecessor.\n\nIf you connect together two squares in this way and one of them has a number in it, the appropriate number will appear in the other square. If you connect two non-numbered squares, they will be assigned temporary algebraic labels: on the first occasion, they will be labelled ‘a’ and ‘a+1’, and then ‘b’ and ‘b+1’, and so on. Connecting more squares on to the ends of such a chain will cause them all to be labelled with the same letter.\n\nWhen you left-click or right-click in a square, the legal squares to connect it to will be shown.\n\nThe arrow in each square starts off black, and goes grey once you connect the square to its successor. Also, each square which needs a predecessor has a small dot in the bottom left corner, which vanishes once you link a square to it. So your aim is always to connect a square with a black arrow to a square with a dot.\n\nTo remove any links for a particular square (both incoming and outgoing), left-drag it off the grid. To remove a whole chain, right-drag any square in the chain off the grid."
